# Shrekvery Ditch Day Escape Room Code Modules

This is a collection of codes used to run puzzles and the networked leaderboard for the Shrekvery ditch day escape room. 

The `swamp_adventure` module is a text-based adventure game that allows players to explore a swamp and solve puzzles. 

The `leaderboard` module is a set of programs designed to be hosted on an EC2 instance such that a different machine in each of the escape rooms may be connected to the host and show a real-time leaderboard which updates as players complete puzzles in each room.
